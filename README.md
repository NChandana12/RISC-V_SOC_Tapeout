Welcome to my documentation of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**!  
This repository captures my week-by-week journey of learning, experimenting, and building — all the way from **RTL design** to **silicon tapeout** 🚀

## 🌟 About the Program  

*"From code to chip — transforming Verilog RTL into silicon-ready layouts using open-source tools."*  

The VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program is India’s largest collaborative silicon design initiative, where 3500+ participants contribute to the open-source RISC-V ecosystem.  

This program offers hands-on exposure to:  
- RTL Design and Simulation  
- 🔄 Synthesis & Logic Optimization  
- 🏗️ Physical Design Flow  
- 🧪 Verification, DRC, and LVS  
- 🎯 Tapeout Preparation & GDSII Generation
